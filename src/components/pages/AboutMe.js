            I recently graduated Duke University with degrees in Computer Science and Linguistics.
            I also have extensive coursework in Mathematics, Music, and the Natural Sciences.
            Some of my favorite hobbies include running, singing, and learning languages.

            I'm eager to take on new projects! Let's work together.
