        <div className = 'Description'>
            I recently graduated Duke University with degrees in Computer Science and Linguistics.
            I also have extensive coursework in Mathematics, Music, and the Natural Sciences.
            Some of my favorite hobbies include running, singing, and learning languages. 
            (Hablo español y 한국어룰 잘한다.)
            I'm eager to take on new projects! Let's work together.
